# Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) Calculator
This project is a calculator that evaluates mathematical expressions written in Reverse Polish Notation (RPN). It also supports plotting graphs for functions. The project is implemented in the C programming language.
# What is Reverse Polish Notation?
Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) is a mathematical notation in which operators follow their operands. For example:
1. Input: 3 + 4             RPN:3 4 +
2. Input: (1 + 2) * 4 + 3   RPN: 1 2 + 4 * 3 +

# How to Use
1. Enter an math expression.
Example: sin(x) * cos(x/2)
2. The program will evaluate the expression and print the result or plot the graph.
# Supported operations:
Basic arithmetic: +, -, *, /, unary minus
Trigonometric functions: sin(), cos(), tg(), ctg()
Logarithmic functions: ln()
Square root: sqrt()
# Build and Run
1. git clone https://github.com/veranemoloko/reverse_polish_notation.git
2. cd reverse_polish_notation 
3. make
4. ./graph
